- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
  Started on the 
    HTML structure and made sure all 
      the links,Headers and the introductory sentence was made. Then, I started on CSS to started styling the elements from HTML starting from installing the background and images and then styling them.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
 <div class="register">
      <input type="submit"  value="Registration" id="search">
  </div>
```
```css

body{
  box-sizing: border-box;
  background: url("images/bg-desktop.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat,no-repeat;
  background-color: rebeccapurple;
}
```


### Continued development

I plan on continuing focusing on my CSS skills, was stuck on some parts while trying to style certain elements and realized it was so simple.
